# Shifts Challenge

This repository contains the code for our solution to the **White Matter Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain** track within Shifts Challenge. It is based on the [baseline code](https://github.com/Shifts-Project/shifts/tree/main/mswml) provided by the challenge organizers.
